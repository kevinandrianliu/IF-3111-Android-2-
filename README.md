### Kevin Andrian Liwinata/K1/13516118

See the task at [ADF-Practical Gitbook Version 1]https://google-developer-training.github.io/android-developer-fundamentals-course-practicals/en/Unit%201/22_p_activity_lifecycle_&_state.html

###Note
Instead of doing only lesson 2.2 itself by copying the source code from the Solution Code from Lesson 2.1, I'd rather to do from Lesson 2.1 to build Two Activities Project and not copying into separate project(It means I don't do subtask 1.1 from Lesson 2.2.
